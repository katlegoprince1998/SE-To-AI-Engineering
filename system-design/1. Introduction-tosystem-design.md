## System Design

### What is System Design?
A collection of components (servers, databases, services, etc.) that work together to achieve a specific goal.

### A system usually includes:
1. Logic (code, services, business rules)
2. Data (databases, files)
3. Interfaces (APIs, UI)
4. Infrastructure (servers, networks)
5. Users

### Example: Online Banking Application

**Flow:**
1. User logs in  
2. User checks balance  
3. User withdraws money  
4. System validates, processes, stores, and reports  

Multiple components working together form a **system**.

## Functional vs Non-Functional Requirements

Requirements describe the **features** and **behaviors** of a system.

---

### Functional Requirements

**Question:**  
What should the system be able to do?

**Examples:**
1. User should be able to log in  
2. User can send a message  
3. System can process a payment  
4. Admin can block a user  

Think in terms of **actions** and **users**.

---

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Question:**  
How well should the system perform those actions?

These describe **quality attributes**.

**Examples:**
1. Performance  
2. Scalability  
3. Security  
4. Reliability  
5. Maintainability  

Think in terms of **constraints** and **quality**.

### Functional vs Non-Functional Comparison

| Functional        | Non-Functional              |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|
| Send a message    | Message delivered in < 1s   |
| Process payment   | 99.99% uptime               |
| Search movies     | Handle 1M users             |
| Login             | Secure (encryption)         |
