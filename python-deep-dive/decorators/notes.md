## Decorators

# What is a decorator ??
  -> Is a function that modifies or extends another functions behavior without changing its code.

# Why decorators exist ?? 
  -> Help you to:
     1. Reuse common logic
     2. keep code clean (DRY)
     3. Separate concerns (logging, auth, timing, caching)
    
# Typical use cases
  1. Logging 
  2. Authentication / authorization
  3. measuring execution time
  4. Validation
  5. Caching

>> In python functions can:
   - Be assigned to variables
   - Be passed as arguments
   - Be returned from other functions
