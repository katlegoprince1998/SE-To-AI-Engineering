## Encapsulation

# What is encapsulation ?? 
  >> This about protecting data inside your class
  >> Controls how data and methods can be accessed 
  >> Help avoid accidental modification of data

# Private Properties
  >> You can make properties private by using a double underscore (__) prefix
  >> Private properties cannot be accessed directly from outside the class
  >> You can use a getter method to access grant objects or classes outside the class access.
  >> You can use a setter method to update a private property - which can also validate the input before modifying the property. 

# Why use data encapsulation
  >> Data protection -> Prevents accidental modification
  >> Validation ->  You can validate data before setting it 
  >> Flexibility -> internal implementation can change without affecting external code
  >> Control -> You have full control over how data is accessed and modified. 

# Protected
  >> Use single _ prefix
