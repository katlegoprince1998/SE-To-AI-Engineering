## Inheritance

# What is Inheritance
  >> Allows us to create a class that inherits from another class
  >> Parent class - also called base class - is the one a class inherits from
  >> Child class - also called derived class - is the class that inherits from another class.

# How to inherit from another class
  >> Pass the parent class as a parameter on the child class

# __int__() function
  >> Add it if you no longer want to inherit the parents __init__() function
  >> To keep the __init__() function of the parent class, explicitly call it 
  >> You can use super() function to make the child class inherit all methods and properties of the parent class
